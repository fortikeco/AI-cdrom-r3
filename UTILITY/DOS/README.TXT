WELCOME TO THE AI CD-ROM REVISION 3!

The AI CD-ROM is the original and most complete collection of files about
artificial intelligence and other advanced machine technologies available.
Unlike many other CD-ROMs that are around today, this one is not a disk
image of single Internet or BBS site or but a collection of files individually
gathered from all over the world, from many different Internet sites, public
and private research organizations, universities, BBS systems and individual
researchers.

On this new revision of the AI CD-ROM are over 4,000 archives containing more
than 40,000 individual files.  Many of the files that were on the revision 1
and revision 2 discs have been replaced with newer versions and there are
also many completely new files that have been added to this new revision.
A small number of files that were present on earlier revisions have been
removed either because they were time sensitive and no longer of any interest
or because of copyright conflicts or other legal reasons.  We have included
more OS/2 and Macintosh material in this revision due to user requests but
continue to add files for all platforms.

The files have been organized into topical subdirectories in order to make
finding specific files easier.  Like earlier revisions, this CD-ROM contains
individual, descriptive file listings in each topical subdirectory (named
00FILES.LST) as well as a combined, master file listing in the root directory
called MASTER.LST.  All the file listings may be viewed with any standard text
file utility.  We have included a variety of shareware and freeware utilities
that will make using the disc easier in the \UTILITY\DOS directory.  If you
already have a favorite text file utility and a copy of UNZIP, you probably
won't need any of the included utilities but for those who do not have them,
they will come in handy.

As mentioned above, the two most important utilities that you will need to
use this disc are a text file viewer to look at the file listing (one with a
good text string search function will make things even easier) and the unzip
utility to decompress the files you want to use.  The remaining utilities
are provided in case you might want to play with some of the files intended
for Mac, Unix, or other platforms that are archived in different ways.

If you intend to use PKzip or some other unzip utility of your own rather
than the INFO-Zip utilities provided on the disc please be sure to use the
appropriate command line arguments needed to extract directory information.
Many of the zipped archives contain directories and, while INFO-zip will
automatically sense and extract directory information, some unzip utilities
such as PKzip will ignore directory information unless specific arguments are
given.

The Ghostscript utility is provided at the request of many of the users of
prevision revisions of the AI CD-ROM.  It is somewhat complicated to install
and use a lot of memory but provides a way to view the many Post Script format
files on the disc without the need for a Post Script compatible printer.


OTHER IMPORTANT FILES

There are several important files that you will find in the \utility\docs
directory of  the CD-ROM.  You might want to print these files for future
reference.

REGISTER.TXT    This file is very important.  This is the registration form
for the AI CD-ROM.  You should print it, fill it out, and mail it in as soon
as possible.  Doing so will cause your name to be entered into our database
so that you can be informed when the AI CD-ROM Revision 4 and other new CD-ROM
title become available.

COMMENTS.TXT    This form contains a number of questions about what you like
and don't like about the AI CD-ROM.  We like to receive feedback from our
users and will try to act on any suggestions that would improve the disc. In
particular, it is important to let us know if there are files that you find
to be very useful so that we can include more of that type of material on
future revisions of the disc.

SUBMIT.INF      These are the submission guidelines for anyone who would like
to find out how to submit a program or file for the next revision of the AI
CD-ROM. You will also need the fill out the form in the file SUBMIT.TXT to
include with any submissions.

SUBMIT.TXT      This form should be filled out and sent in with any file that
you would like to submit for a future version of the AI CD-ROM. It also
contains instructions on how to submit files.

PROBLEM.TXT     You should use this form if you run into any problems such as
duplicate files, corrupt files, or, even though it's very unlikely, a virus.
It will provide us with information that we will need to correct the problem.

USE_WHAT.DOC    This file contains a listing of archiver formats and names
that may help if you run across something you can't identify.  We have tried
where ever possible to keep all files in ZIP archive format.  However a few
have to be in other formats in order to make them easier to use on certain
computer platforms.  Macintosh files will usually be in BinHex 4 format which
can be recognized by the .HQX extension on the files.  Some Unix based files
may be in TAR or SHAR format after they have been unzipped.


A NOTE ABOUT WINDOWS PROGRAMS

While there are quite a few MS Windows based programs on this disc, we have
included them in the DOS catagory to make things simpler. There are so many
incompatible versions of Windows (2.x, 3.0, 3.1, WIN32, WIN32s, Chicago, WFWG,
Chairo, Win95, etc.) that is seems pointless to try to identify which files
go with which version of Windows. The key thing that most people need to know
about the files is that they are DOS programs as opposed to UNIX, MAC or OS/2
programs. The fact that they need a particular DOS shell such as Windows 3.x
to run is secondary.  Also, we noticed as we tested many of the Window related
files that while many would only run with particular versions or types of MS
Windows, 99% of them ran fine on our OS/2 system.  If you run into trouble
trying to get one of the Windows programs to run, try it under OS/2 before
giving up on it (you'll get better performance and reliability in many cases
even for the ones which do run on DOS & Windows X.x systems).


A NOTE ABOUT DOS VERSIONS

A few programs we have run into (particularly some of the older ones) seem
to require a specific DOS version to run - usually an old one such as 3.x.
As with the Windows problems, we found this could often be gotten around by
using them under OS/2's DOS emulation.  Another thing to try is the feature
on  DOS 5.0 and above that allows you specify selected DOS versions number to
selected programs in the CONFIG.SYS file. In some cases, however, there will
simply be nothing you can do aside from actually installing an old version
of DOS.  If you run across any files that you simply cannot get to work for
this reason or any other, please take the time to fill out a problem report on
the files so that we can look into it. At the very least, this will allow us
to add a warning in the file description on the next revision of the CD-ROM.


A NOTE ABOUT SHAREWARE

Many of the programs found on this disc are shareware.  This means that the
authors are allowing you to evaluate their programs for a limited time and
decide whether or not they suit your needs.  After some specified amount of
time, you must pay the author directly for the program if you decide to
continue to use it. The purchase price of this CD-ROM does not go to the
authors of these programs nor give you any rights of usage or ownership to
their programs.  For more information see the documentation that accompanies
each file.

It is important to remember that shareware is not free - it is commercial,
copyrighted software that is distributed on a trial basis.  Using shareware
without paying the shareware fee is a violation of the authors copyright and
also deprives the author of income that would encourage him or her to write
more useful shareware programs.


A NOTE TO BBS SYSOPS

While Network Cybernetics Corporation has no objections in general to the
on-line use of this CD-ROM on a BBS, it is up to the SysOp to determine if
such use would violate the terms of any specific program or file on this
disc. Some files, such as CLIPS and SPICER are not intended for unrestricted
distribution and making them available on a BBS may have important legal
ramifications.  Also, some files on this disc are used by specific permission
of their authors strictly for inclusion on this disc and further distribtion
is a violation of the author's copyright.  Due to these legal points, we do
not include FILES.BBS or other BBS-ready file listings.  Many of the files
found on the disc are freeware or shareware and can be distributed on a BBS
but it is up to the individual SysOp to determine which files may be legally
used in a given manner.  NETWORK CYBERNETICS CORPORATION WILL NOT BE LIABLE
FOR DAMAGES OR LEGAL PROBLEMS RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS CD-ROM ON A BBS.


ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE NASA SOFTWARE ON THIS CD-ROM

CLIPS, NETS, SPLICER and the other NASA software that is on this disc were
created by NASA and are a spin-off of the space program.  They are included
on this CD-ROM by written permission of the director of COSMIC.  For more
information on any of these programs or to obtain printed documentation for
NETS or SPICER, contact COSMIC at the address found in the CLIPS documentation
files on this disc.

United States federal law prohibits the export of CLIPS (and this CD-ROM which
contains it) to certain countries.  Transfer via modem, disc, ftp, or other
electronic means is included in the concept of "export".  A list of the
countries to which export is prohibited may be obtained from the COSMIC or
the US Dept. of Commerce. A general rule of thumb is that if the country in
question does not have a US Embassy, then export of this software would be in
violation of the law.  For more information refer to the CLIPS documentation.


DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY AND OTHER SMALL PRINT

This CD-ROM is provided by Network Cybernetics Corporation "AS-IS" without
warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to implied

on this disc remains with you.

IN NO EVENT SHALL NETWORK CYBERNETICS CORPORATION BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES
(INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFIT, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS
OF INFORMATION, OR OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING FROM THE USE OR INABILITY
TO USE THIS DISC OR THE FILES IT CONTAINS.

In states which do not allow the exclusion or limitation of implied warranties
or liability for consequential or incidental damages, some of the above may
not apply.
