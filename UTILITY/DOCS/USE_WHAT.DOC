Common and uncommon file compression schemes. Where ever possible the
files on this disc have been converted to plain ZIP files. There are
a few cases where this hasn't been done for one reason or another. In
most cases the exceptions will be UNIX TAR archives contained within
ZIP files. There are also a few Macintosh files stored in Binhex v4
format (.HQX).  And in rare cases you will find an archive that has
multiple levels of archived files within it. In such cases, the deeper
levels may have unpredictable archive formats. Happy archiving...
